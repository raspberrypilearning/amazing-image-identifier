Which of the following do you not need to consider when using a machine vision model created by someone else?

--- choices ---

- ( ) The size of image the model expects

  --- feedback ---
  If the image you give a model is too large, too small, or the wrong shape, this can harm the model's ability to correctly classify it.
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) The types of image the model was trained on

  --- feedback ---
  The model should be trained on the correct classes of image for the problem your application is solving. Since this application was intended to recognise most things it could be shown, you used the very broad VGG16 model.
  --- /feedback ---

- (x) How many layers the model has

  --- feedback ---
  One of the major advantages of using a model created by someone else is you don't need to understand exactly how they built it! The number of layers in the model isn't something you need to know to decide if it is suitable for your project.
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) How accurately the model classifies images

  --- feedback ---
  You should be sure that the model you choose works, particularly in the kinds of situations where you expect users of your application to be trying to use it. Just because someone else made it, doesn't mean it's guaranteed to work!
