## Share

As well as showing friends, family members, or people in a coding club, you can share your code with the world by putting it on GitHub. GitHub is a website where you can use a tool called Git to store and share coding projects, which Git calls **repositories**, or **repos** for short. Git, and GitHub, are used by millions of professional computer programmers every day. Every project on this website is stored on GitHub.

#### Be careful what you share

GitHub is on the web, so you should be just as careful about the kind of information you share there as you would on any other website or app: Don't include photos of yourself, or your friends; Don't include passwords or usernames; If you're ever unsure about sharing anything online, check with an adult you trust first.

#### Sharing your code on GitHub

To share your code on GitHub you'll need to setup a GitHub account (or log into one you already have), create a new repository for this project, and then **commit** (upload) your code to the repository.

If you're over the age of thirteen, you can register for your own GitHub account. If you're not, you'll need a parent or guardian to set up an account and allow you to use it.

Create an account by filling in the relevant details on the [GitHub site](https://github.com/join).

Once you have an account go to the [GitHub site](https://github.com/), make sure you're signed in, and click on the 'New Repository' button, which appears on the left.

In the screen that appears, you will need to give your repository a name. You can also add a description, if you like.

For now, leave the repository set to public, and don't worry about any of the three checkboxes. Just click the 'Create repository' button.

Once the repository has been created, you'll be shown a number of options on how to get started. In the 'Quick setup' section, choose the 'uploading an existing file' link.

You will then be presented with a screen that gives you options to createa a commit. Drag any files that form part of your project into the repository — again, remembering to be careful about what you put on the web — and then give the commit a name. Since you can commit new versions of files later, the name of the commit helps you remember when you last changed a particular file. Since this is the very first commit of the project, you can pick a simple name like 'Version 1', 'First commit', etc. You can also add a more detailed description of the commit, if you like.

Then click the 'Commit changes' button to save your commit!

#### Making changes to your repository
Once you've made some changes to your project, you might want to update the version of it you're sharing in your repository. To change your repository, all you need to do is upload your files again, as part of a new commit.

On the GitHub page for your repository (which you can find on the left of [github.com](https://github.com) if you're signed in), you will be able to choose to upload files using the 'Add file' menu.

You will then be presented with a screen that gives you options to createa a commit. Drag any files that form part of your project into the repository — again, remembering to be careful about what you put on the web — and then give the commit a name. Don't worry about whether or not you've changed a file, GitHub will figure that out for you.

Then click the 'Commit changes' button to save your commit, and update your project.

#### Sharing your repository

You can share your repository by sharing the URL to it. It should look something like [https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/amazing-image-identifier](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/amazing-image-identifier) but with your GitHub username in place of `raspberrypilearning` and your repository's name in place of `amazing-image-identifier`. Because you left the repository set to public when you created it, anyone should be able to see it.
