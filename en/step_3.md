The model for this project has been trained on the absolutely huge [ImageNet dataset](http://image-net.org/explore). It is able to recognise many common plants, animals, and objects, often to quite a specific level. For example, it can identify breeds of animals rather than just species. As such, you can connect the classifications output by this model to a wide variety of code and other data sources to create a number of different products.

Here are some examples of the kinds of web pages, apps, etc. you can create as part of this project:
